##  Challenges & Accomplishments

### Challenges I Faced:
Building a 3D portfolio came with its own set of challenges:

1. **Integrating 3D Models**  
   Working with **3D models** caused several **performance issues** and **crashes**. I had to troubleshoot by optimizing model sizes, **refactoring my code**, and applying **lazy loading** techniques to improve performance.

2. **Learning New Libraries**  
   Before this project, I was unfamiliar with **React Three Fiber** and **React Three Drei**. It required me to dive deep into documentation and tutorials to understand how to work with **3D components** in React.

### Accomplishments I'm Proud Of:
- Creating an **engaging, interactive portfolio** that effectively showcases my skills and projects.
- Successfully integrating complex **3D models and animations** using **Three.js**.
- Winning **positive feedback** from peers and mentors for the **unique design and functionality**.
- Gaining a deep understanding of **Three.js**, **React Three Fiber**, and **Tailwind CSS**, which strengthened my front-end development skills.
